# Hi am Joseph Nkwantabisa 
A youg and slow thinker getting my way  in computing and  
programming , in case im not doing fine , take a break 
im not a chikd prodigy that started coding at 8 like sir linus Torvalds
Sir Gates at thirtheen and all the other guys 
I started coding intersively just when im 20 , 2022 september 
i took some php,python c++, c# and java courses and i loved c++ so much
but was a lot for me and didnt have to money to but embacardero's 
software for mobile development so i took on to java which is kinda "low-level" too at least 
and im into JAVA right now to find my way in ANDROID programming, main nich.
This is not end of the story i would also love to see myself as an 
embedded system developer, computer architect(hardware engineer) and hardware stuff !
